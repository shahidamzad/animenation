# Choclate Can

A small web animation/demo built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**Project Overview**: This repository contains a lightweight animated web page (index.html) with styling in `style.css` and behaviour in `script.js`. Visual assets are stored in the `Assets/` folder.

**Files**
- `index.html`: main HTML page.
- `style.css`: styles and layout for the animation.
- `script.js`: animation logic and interactivity.
- `Assets/`: images and other media used by the page.

**Tools & Applications Used**
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (recommended) — for editing files and running extensions.
- **Live preview**: Live Server (VS Code extension) or any static file server to preview `index.html` during development.
- **Browser**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) — use developer tools for debugging and profiling.
- **Languages / Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Version control**: Git (optional) for tracking changes and collaboration.
- **Asset tools**: Image/audio assets were prepared using standard image editors (Photoshop, GIMP, or similar) as needed.

**How to run**
1. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or
2. Serve the folder with Live Server (VS Code) or a simple static server and visit the served URL.

If you'd like, I can expand this README with usage instructions, credits for assets, or a changelog.
